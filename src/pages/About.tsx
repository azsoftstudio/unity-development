            Unity development shouldn't be about fighting with toolsâ€”it should be about bringing your creative vision to life. 
            That's why we create assets that feel like natural extensions of Unity itself, tools that work the way you think, 
            and solutions that save you hours of tedious work so you can focus on what really matters: making great games.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                AZSoftStudio was founded by a passionate Unity developer with over 8 years of experience shipping 
                commercial games and tools. After countless hours spent on repetitive tasks and wrestling with 
                Unity's quirks, the vision became clear: create the tools that every Unity developer wishes existed.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Our Approach</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Every tool we create starts with a real problem we've encountered in our own development work. 
                We prototype, iterate, and test extensively before releasing anything to the community. 
                This ensures that every asset we publish is something we'd actually want to use ourselves.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We believe the best tools are built in collaboration with the community. Your feedback,
